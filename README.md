# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

  Auction Contract
    Initialization
      ✔ should initialize auction correctly
    Bidding Logic
      ✔ should allow a bid and update highest bidder

      ✔ should revert if bid is not higher than current
      ✔ should revert if auction has ended
    Ending Auction
      ✔ should end auction and transfer NFT to winner
      ✔ should return NFT if no bids
      ✔ should revert if called before auction ends
      ✔ should revert if called by unauthorized user
    Price Calculation
      ✔ should get correct ETH/USD price
      ✔ should calculate USD value of ETH correctly
    UUPS Upgrade Support
      ✔ should upgrade contract successfully
